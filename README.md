# Project Title

## 2022 Google Solutions Challenge Project

The [Google Solutions Challenge](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge) is an annual event hosted by Google
to give prospective developers the opportunity to contribute to society by leveraging
various software technologies to solve or work towards solving at least [1 of the UN's
17 sustainable development goals](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/).

In 2022, we decided to take on this challenge.

## How to Use

Once installed, use npm or yarn to build a version of the pwa.
When you do that, you should see a build folder. You should run this build file on
a server. Once you run the app in production mode, you can install the app as a pwa.

There are many ways to run the app on a server. One way is to use npm or yarn to install or add serve and run it on there

If you do not do a production build of the app, you will not be able to install the app as a pwa.
